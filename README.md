This is a mod that recreates NeXi2k's NeXi-Client from 2020 (Valorant Mod Variant).
Do NOT open the JSON files for any reason, leave them as they are (just copy paste them into your Swapper). Opening and altering them is unauthorized (not allowed) and the developers will know if you open and alter them, so don't even go for it, or you can receive a PERMANENT BAN!
If you have your own viewmodel.js that would be recommended for use, as all the ones i have tried either crash the game or are unresponsive.
Make sure to use these measurements:
x: 0.50
y: 0.58
z: -0.80
(Use 60 as your Weapon FOV)
Enjoy, and as always, DM me if there are any issues at justjoe0247 on discord.
